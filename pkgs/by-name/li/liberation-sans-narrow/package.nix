      Liberation Sans Narrow is a font originally created by Ascender
      Inc and licensed to Oracle Corporation under a GPLv2 license.
      It is metrically compatible with the commonly used Arial Narrow
      fonts on Microsoft systems.  It is no longer distributed with
      the latest versions of the Liberation Fonts, as Red Hat has
      changed the license to the Open Font License.
